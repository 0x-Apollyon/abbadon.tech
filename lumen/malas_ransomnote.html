Your files have been encrypted with AES military-grade encryption. Our data
recovery and security specialists can help you decrypt your files and secure
your server from hackers. Contact us and we'll provide a decrypter that will
safely and quickly restore your files. Any other attempts to recover your files
will be a waste of your time and money, and risk permanent data loss.  Your
files have been securely encrypted with AES, and the only way to decrypt is by
sending us the contents of the \"BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE\" block below, which
we can use to create a decrypter for you.

Unlike traditional ransomware groups, we're not asking you to send us money. We
just dislike corporations and economic inequality. We simply ask that you make a
donation to a non-profit that we approve of. It's a win-win, you can probably
get a tax deduction and good PR from your donation if you want.
