We are the Abyss. Your company Servers are crypted and your data has been stolen to our servers. Good news for you: 1) We can restore your entire system. 2) We are not interested in publishing your information. 3) Our motivation is purely financial. 4) We are open to negotiations. 5) We are ready to maintain complete confidentiality of this incident. Let's explain the further steps in the situation: You can seek help from authorities - unfortunately, this path will not lead to a constructive resolution of the situation. They will not assist you with decryption, seize your servers for OPsec, and your company's operations will be halted. Subsequently, the date will be disclosed, leading to fines, legal actions, and reputational damage. OR You initiate negotiations with us, and we reach a mutually beneficial and constructive solution for both parties. You pay a specified amount and receive the full decryption, support throughout the decryption process, proofs that all information on our servers has been deleted, and a guarantee that it will never resurface, ensuring no one learns about this incident. To initiate negotiations, please download the Tor Browser using their official website: https://www.torproject.org/ use these credentials to enter the Chat for text negotiation: http://jqlcrn2fsfvxlngdq53rqyrwtwfrulup74xyle54bsvo3l2kgpeeijid.onion/[snip] There will be no bad news for your company after successful negotiations for both sides. But there will be plenty of those bad news if case of failed negotiations, so don’t think about how to avoid it. Just focus on negotiations, payment and decryption to make all of your problems solved by our specialists within 1 day after payment received: servers and data restored, everything will work good as new.

You don’t care in any case, because you just don’t want to pay hackers? - We will make you business stop forever by using all of our experience to make your partners, clients, employees and whoever cooperates with your company change their minds by having no choice but to stay away from your company. As a result, in midterm you will have to close your business. So lets get straight to the point. What do we offer in exchange on your payment: - decryption and restoration of all your systems and data within 24 hours with 100% guarantee; - never inform anyone about the data breach out from your company; - after data decryption and system restoration, we will delete all of your data from your servers forever; - provide valuable advising on your company IT protection so no one can attack your again.
