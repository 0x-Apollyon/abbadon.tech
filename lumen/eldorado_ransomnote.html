Your network has been attacked through various vulnerabilities found in your system.
We have gained full access to the entire network infrastructure.

All your confidential information about all employees and all partners and developments has been downloaded to our servers and is located with us.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Our team has an extensive background in legal and so called white hat hacking.
However, clients usually considered the found vulnerabilities to be minor and poorlyr\n
paid for our services.
So we decided to change our business model. Now you understand how important it isr\n

to allocate a good budget for IT security.
This is serious business for us and we really don't want to ruin your privacy,r\n
reputation and a company.
We just want to get paid for our work whist finding vulnerabilities in various networks.

Your files are currently encrypted with our tailor made state of the art algorithm.
Don't try to terminate unknown processes, don't shutdown the servers, do not unplug drives,
all this can lead to partial or complete data loss.

We have also managed to download a large amount of various, crucial data from your network.
A complete list of files and samples will be provided upon request.

We can decrypt a couple of files for free. The size of each file must be no more than 5 megabytes.

All your data will be successfully decrypted immediately after your payment.
You will also receive a detailed list of vulnerabilities used to gain access to your network.
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

If you refuse to cooperate with us, it will lead to the following consequences for your company:
1. All data downloaded from your network will be published for free or even sold
2. Your system will be re-attacked continuously, now that we know all your weak spotsr

3. We will also attack your partners and suppliers using info obtained from your network
4. It can lead to legal actions against you for data breaches
