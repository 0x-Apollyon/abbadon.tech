Dear company,

This is an automated alert from cybersecurity team Rhysida. An unfortunate situation has arisen - your digital ecosystem has been compromised, and a substantial amount of confidential data has been exfiltrated from your network. The potential ramifications of this could be dire, including the sale, publication, or distribution of your data to competitors or media outlets. This could inflict significant reputational and financial damage.

However, this situation is not without a remedy.

Our team has developed a unique key, specifically designed to restore your digital security. This key represents the first and most crucial step in recovering from this situation. To utilize this key, visit our secure portal: rhysidafohrhyy2aszi7bm32tnjat5xri65fopcxkdfxhi4tidsg7cad.onion with your secret key [snip]

It's vital to note that any attempts to decrypt the encrypted files independently could lead to permanent data loss. We strongly advise against such actions.

Time is a critical factor in mitigating the impact of this breach. With each passing moment, the potential damage escalates. Your immediate action and full cooperation are required to navigate this scenario effectively.

Rest assured, our team is committed to guiding you through this process. The journey to resolution begins with the use of the unique key. Together, we can restore the security of your digital environment.
